# Lagoon SDKs

A collection of Software Development Kits to ease interactions with Lagoon Vaults, inspired by ![Morpho's SDK architecture](https://github.com/morpho-org/sdks).

## Getting Started

### Viem

[**`@lagoon-protocol/v0-viem`**](./packages/v0-viem/): Viem-based utilities for Lagoon Vault interactions. This package provides helper functions for fetching vault data and performing vault operations, extending the core functionality from [v0-core](./packages/v0-core/).
